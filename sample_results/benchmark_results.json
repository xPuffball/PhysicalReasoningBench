      "response": "Physical Principles:\nThe main physical principle at work here is buoyancy, which is the force that allows objects to float in a fluid. The force of buoyancy is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. This principle is known as Archimedes' Principle. In this case, the ping pong ball in the tube will float to the top when there is enough fluid in the tube, as the ball is less dense than the fluid.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Open the bottle of water.\n2. Carefully pour the water into the tube until it is filled.\n3. Wait for the ping pong ball to float to the top of the tube.\n4. Once the ball has reached the top, use a squishy food model or the milk carton to cover the top of the tube to prevent the ball from falling back down.\n5. Tilt the tube to allow the ball to roll out onto the surface, ensuring the top of the tube remains covered until the ball is out.\n\nRequired Items:\n- Bottle of water: This is needed to fill the tube and make the ping pong ball float to the top. It provides the fluid necessary for buoyancy to occur.\n- Squishy food model or milk carton: These are needed to cover the top of the tube and prevent the ball from falling back down once it has floated to the top. They are large enough to cover the tube and flexible enough to form a seal."

      "response": "Physical Principles:\nThe key physical principle involved in this escape room puzzle is the principle of fluorescence under UV light. Certain materials, when exposed to ultraviolet light, absorb the light and re-emit it almost instantaneously. Some substances will emit visible light upon being struck by UV light. This is known as fluorescence. This principle can be used to reveal otherwise invisible residues, such as fingerprints, on certain surfaces.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Turn on the UV light and shine it onto the number lock. The UV light will cause any residue left by fingers pressing the buttons to fluoresce, making them visible.\n2. Look for any glowing marks or fingerprints on the buttons of the number lock. These will indicate which buttons have been pressed.\n3. Try pressing the buttons with the glowing marks in any order (since the order doesn't matter in this case). You may need to try a few combinations if multiple buttons show signs of being pressed.\n4. Once the correct combination is entered, the lock should open, allowing you to proceed to the next part of the escape room challenge.\n\nRequired Items:\n1. UV Light: This is required to make the otherwise invisible fingerprints on the buttons visible through fluorescence.\n2. Safety Goggles: Safety goggles are needed to protect the eyes from potentially harmful UV light. Even though UV light is invisible to the naked eye, it can still cause damage to the eyes if directly exposed.\n3. Lab Equipment: In this case, the lab equipment seems to be a red herring. While it could potentially be used in other escape room puzzles, it does not seem to be necessary for solving this particular puzzle."

      "response": "Physical Principles:\nThe physical principles involved in this puzzle are substitution cipher and rotational motion. A substitution cipher is a method of encoding by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system. The 'units' may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. In this case, 'A=N' likely means that each letter in the jumbled message must be replaced with the letter that is located the same number of spaces forward in the alphabet. Rotational motion refers to the movement of the dual-ring dial, which can be turned to align different letters and decipher the code.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Start by understanding the given clue 'A=N'. This suggests that each letter should be replaced by the letter 13 positions ahead in the alphabet.\n2. Now, look at the jumbled message on the wall. Each letter in this message should be replaced by the letter 13 positions ahead in the alphabet.\n3. Go to the dual-ring dial. One ring likely represents the original alphabet (plaintext), and the other represents the cipher alphabet (ciphertext).\n4. Rotate the rings to align 'A' on the plaintext ring with 'N' on the ciphertext ring. This follows from the clue 'A=N'.\n5. Now, for each letter in the jumbled message, find the corresponding letter in the cipher alphabet. This should be done by finding the letter in the plaintext ring and noting the letter aligned in the ciphertext ring.\n6. Write down these corresponding letters in the order they appear in the jumbled message. The resulting sequence should form a coherent sentence or phrase, which is the deciphered message.\n\nRequired Items:\n- 'A=N' reference: This is the key to the substitution cipher. It tells you how to align the dual-ring dial and how to replace the letters in the jumbled message.\n- Jumbled message on wall: This is the encoded message that needs to be decoded using the substitution cipher.\n- Dual-ring dial with letters: This device is used to apply the substitution cipher. By aligning the letters according to the 'A=N' clue, you can easily find the corresponding letter for each letter in the jumbled message."

      "response": "Physical Principles:\nThe main physical principle involved in this solution is the concept of air pressure differential, which is the same principle that allows a suction cup to stick to a surface. Air pressure is higher on one side of the suction cup (outside) compared to the other (inside), and this difference in pressure causes the cup to stick to the surface.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Attach the suction cup to the top of the can. The flat surface of the can should provide a good contact for the suction cup to adhere to.\n2. Once the suction cup is firmly attached, gently pull upwards. The air pressure differential should cause the suction cup (and thus the can) to be lifted out of the hole.\n3. Once the can is out of the hole, remove the suction cup from the top of the can.\n4. Use the UV light to illuminate the combination written on the bottom of the can. Some inks only become visible under UV light, which is why this step is necessary.\n5. Write down the combination on the notebook to ensure it's not forgotten.\n\nRequired Items:\n- Suction cup: This is required to adhere to the can and pull it out of the hole, as the can fits too tightly for finger grip.\n- UV light: This is required to reveal the combination written on the bottom of the can, as it may be written in ink that only becomes visible under UV light.\n- Notebook: This is required to record the combination once it's visible, ensuring it's not forgotten."

      "response": "Physical Principles:\nThe physical principles involved in this scenario are gravity and friction. Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards the earth. We can use this force to our advantage by dropping items from a height, or rolling them along a flat surface. Friction is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. We can use friction to move the key closer to the cells.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Roll out enough toilet paper from one cell such that it reaches the key. Be careful not to break the toilet paper.\n2. From the other cell, do the same with the paper sheets. Make sure they overlap the toilet paper near the key. \n3. Carefully and slowly pull the toilet paper and the paper sheets back towards the respective cells. The friction between the paper and the floor will cause the key to move towards the cell.\n4. Continue pulling until the key is close enough to reach through the bars.\n5. Grab the key and unlock the cell doors.\n\nRequired Items:\n- Roll of toilet paper: It is lightweight and can be unrolled to reach the key. Also, the friction between it and the floor can be used to drag the key closer.\n- Paper sheets: These are also lightweight and can be slid along the floor to reach the key. They can also create friction with the floor which can move the key.\n- Key on the floor: This is the ultimate target. The key is needed to unlock the cells."

      "response": "Physical Principles:\nThe solution to this puzzle involves using the principles of buoyancy and capillary action. Buoyancy is the upward force exerted on an object immersed in a fluid, which can be used to lift the ping pong ball. Capillary action, on the other hand, is the ability of a liquid to flow through narrow spaces without the assistance of, and sometimes against, external forces such as gravity.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Fill the bottle of water partially, leaving some air space at the top.\n2. Carefully insert the water-filled bottle into the narrow tube, ensuring that the water level is just below the ping pong ball.\n3. Gently squeeze the bottle, causing the water to rise up the tube and make contact with the ping pong ball.\n4. The buoyancy of the water will lift the ping pong ball, and the capillary action will pull the water up the tube, carrying the ball with it.\n5. Continue squeezing the bottle and allowing the water to rise until the ping pong ball emerges from the top of the tube.\n\nRequired Items:\n1. Bottle of water: The water is used to create the buoyant force that lifts the ping pong ball.\n2. Squishy food models: These are not needed for the solution.\n3. Milk carton: This is not needed for the solution.\n4. Ice cube: This is not needed for the solution.\n\nThe key items required for this solution are the bottle of water, which is used to create the buoyant force, and the transparent tube, which allows the capillary action to pull the water and the ping pong ball up the tube."

Some materials, when exposed to UV light, can emit visible light or fluorescence, which can reveal hidden information or patterns.\n\nIn this case, the correct combination for the push-button number lock is likely hidden or encoded in some way, and the UV light can be used to reveal it.\n\nSolution Steps:\n1. Carefully examine the lock and the surrounding area using the UV light. Look for any markings, residues, or patterns that may become visible under the UV light.\n2. If the UV light reveals any numbers or a pattern, note down the order in which they appear.\n3.

      "response": "Physical Principles:\n\nThe key physical principles involved in this scenario are the concept of volume and the use of suction to extract the can from the hole. Since the can fits almost exactly into the hole, it is likely that the can is stuck due to the tight fit and the lack of any air gaps or space between the can and the hole. This tight fit creates a vacuum-like effect, making it difficult to grip and pull the can out.\n\nSolution Steps:\n\n1. Measure the diameter of the can using the ruler. This will help determine the size of the hole and confirm that the can fits tightly within it.\n\n2. Inspect the bottom of the can to locate the combination written on it. Use the UV light to illuminate the bottom of the can and make the combination visible, if it is not already clearly visible.\n\n3. Attach the suction cup to the top of the can. The suction cup will create a temporary seal on the can's surface, allowing you to grip and pull it out of the hole.\n\n4. Gently pull the can upwards using the suction cup. The suction force should be strong enough to overcome the vacuum-like effect and extract the can from the hole.\n\n5. Once the can is out, record the combination written on the bottom of the can in the notebook.\n\nRequired Items:\n\n1. Ruler: To measure the diameter of the can and confirm the tight fit in the hole.\n2.
